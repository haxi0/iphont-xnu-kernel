/*
 * en0, and what stands behind it.
 *
 * The network interface iOS uses here is made in bsd/dev/hk_net.c with the kernel's own
 * interface KPI: Ethernet as far as the rest of the kernel and user space can tell. What carries
 * the frames is a "link", a driver of its own that knows nothing about interfaces: QEMU's virtio
 * network device today (bsd/dev/hk_virtio_net.c), the phone's radio or frames carried over
 * the boot loader's USB channel tomorrow. This is all the two know of each other.
 *
 * A link driver
 *   - fills in a struct hk_net_link and calls hk_net_attach() once, when it is ready
 *     to carry frames (for a radio: when its firmware is up, not when it has joined a network);
 *   - hands every frame that arrives to hk_net_input(): from its own thread, or from
 *     the poll function the interface's thread calls for it. Not from interrupt context;
 *   - says with hk_net_link_state() when frames can pass and when they no longer can
 *     (the cable, or for a radio: associated and the keys set). configd starts DHCP on that.
 * A frame is what goes over an Ethernet cable without the checksum at its end: destination,
 * source, type, payload; at most HK_NET_FRAME_MAX bytes. A radio whose frames are 802.11
 * converts in its driver (or has its firmware do it: "Ethernet decap/encap").
